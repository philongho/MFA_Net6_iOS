            After sending this command, if the HI is still open to pairing (HIOpenToARCPairDurationAfterStartup_min=..3 min),
            the HI will interpret the next command as (Brand ID, COM channel) and set the communication channel to the specified COM channel.
            This command can be used repeatedly (as opposed to command PAIRING_ENABLE_MFA).
